## Branching

Branching will be done for each lesson so as to not polute master with in development and potentially buggy code.  Each branch go through a self code review to ensure quality and completeness before merging into `Snip3rM00n/SP_OnlinePy201/Master`.  After all items for the lesson or activity are in `Snip3rM00n/SP_OnlinePy201/Master` they will then be sent as a PR to Upstream (UWPCE-PythonCert-ClassReops/SP_OnlinePy201).
